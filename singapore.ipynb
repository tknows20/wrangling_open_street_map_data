    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After sampling the original openstreetmap data file with `sampler.py`, I noted that the `addr:street` tags contained values that had to be interpreted in context of local naming conventions. It is common to have Singapore addresses end with a number e.g. Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, so I used regular expression to extract the last word that does not contain a number. \n",

    "## Street Names\n",
    "\n",

A way to encourage more users to contribute is through gamification (as suggested in the [Sample Project](https://gist.github.com/carlward/54ec1c91b62a5f911c42#file-sample_project-md)) where users will gain points from adding to a map area. Top ranking contributors could be display on OpenStreetMap's website for better recognition. \n",

    "## Additional Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "While auditing data for the `addr:city` tag, I observed values `563455`, `Ang Mo Kio` and `Holland Village`, which are invalid city names. `563455` is a postcode, and `Ang Mo Kio` and `Holland Village` are street addresses. It is most likely that the addresses were misentered/ shifted across the other `addr` tags. Cleaning up these data entries will require looking at all the `addr` tags associated with a node or way and making sure that they are entered in the correct heading, which will also require some contextual understanding of the addresses in Singapore. I did not clean up these nodes and ways but could do so in the future by coding a section that look at `addr` values in its entirety. \n",

There is an increasing popularity of Korean food, so I am not surprised to see that on the list. I am surprised at seeing French food on the list as it is a relatively more expensive and exclusive option. That said, there has been a rise in accessible French restaurants such as Poulet in Singapore, which might explain for it being on the top 10 list. \n",
